In my question 3 query, I simply joined the 2017 5yr data with the 2018 5yr data to compare the total populations for the zip codes of interest. I used simple calculations to find the difference and percent difference and then limited my final query so that the result reflects only the correct answer. I chose to include percent difference to ensure that the solution was the same when relative to each zip code's population. The solution is that the zip code 77494 had the largest change in population between the two data collections.
