In my question 3 query, I simply joined the 2017 5yr data with the 2018 5yr data to compare the total populations for the zip codes of interest. I used a simple calculation to find the difference and then limited my final query so that the result reflects only the correct answer. The solution is that the zip code 77494 had the largest change in population between the two data collections.
