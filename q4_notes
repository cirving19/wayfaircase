To complete question 4, I wrote CTEs to establish the top 200 zip codes by population and to again unpivot the education level data and choose the most common education level for each zip code. I then assigned each education level a numerical score based on increasing level so that I could better compare the numerical population data to the education level data. Utilizing these tables, I used the corr() function to calculate the correlation between the two variables and the explained variance.
Based on these results, my interpretation would be that there is not a strong relationship between population size and typical education level. A correlation coefficient of -0.05 implies a slight negative relationship (larger population correlates with lower level of education) but does not signify a strong relationship. Squaring the correlation coefficient value gives us an idea of how much of the variance in the education levels could be explained by the population size, and a value of 0.25% is not a strong indication of correlation at all.
