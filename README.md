# Wayfair Case Study
This repo contains my solutions to the take-home case study as a part of the interview process for the Data Analyst, Safety &amp; Security role.

Each solution includes:

- The original query (found in the .sql file `cirving_wayfair_case_queries`)
- The resulting table in CSV format (found in the corresponding csv files)
- My written notes explaining my approach (found in the corresponding notes files)

## Questions Overview

1. **Based on the 2018 ACS 5-year census data, which 10 zip codes have the highest population?**
2. **What is the typical income range and education level for each of these zip codes?**
3. **Of these zip codes, which had the largest change in population from the 2017 5-year data?**
4. **Expanding to look across the top 200 zip codes by population for 2018, is there any correlation between total population and typical education level?**

All work is based on the publicly available dataset `census_bureau_acs` from BigQuery. I utilized the `zip_codes_2018_5yr` and `zip_codes_2017_5yr` data tables.
